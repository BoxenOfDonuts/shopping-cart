# shopping-cart
A simple shopping cart app to get familiar with React Router. You can add items to the cart, and update quantity of each. The item pages are dynamically created by the item id.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
Excited to keep going!
